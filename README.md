# Convolutional Neural Network to Classify Retinal OCT Images (Fall 2020)
## Objective
Optical Coherence Tomography is a Retinal imaging technique used to detect retinal abnormalities. However, the analysis of such images to reach aretinal diagnosis serves to be a difficult and time-consuming task for medical professionals. This project aims to develop the most efficient convolutional neural network model to classify these OCT images. This CNN is then benchmarked against a fully-connected neural network model to demonstrate a CNN's performance in tasks that require spatial context.

## Folder Structure
- `week1` to `week3` contain example notebooks and exercises to get the group acquainted with the basics of ML.
- `OCT-cnn` contains notebooks to train many different models, as well as the weights for the most successful one.
